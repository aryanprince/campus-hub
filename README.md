## üìñ Introduction

Campus Hub is a showcase application featuring three [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) microservices, fully deployed to the cloud for live use. This project includes a Student Portal, a Library Portal, and a Finance Portal, all integrated within a monorepo using [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) and communicating via RESTful APIs.

Built to demonstrate my expertise in modern software development, Campus Hub employs a microservices architecture with independent functionality and separate databases, while leveraging a monorepo for shared code and improved DX. It also implements industry best practices, including CI/CD pipelines, design patterns, and robust architecture.

## üì¶ Directory Structure

Campus Hub is a monorepo managed by [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo). The monorepo contains an `apps`, `packages`, and `tooling` directories.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed first:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)

```bash
brew install node # macOS or Linux (using Homebrew)
winget install -e --id OpenJS.NodeJS # Windows
```

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

```bash
brew install pnpm # macOS or Linux (using Homebrew)
winget install -e --id pnpm.pnpm # Windows
# or using npm
npm install -g pnpm # Install pnpm globally
```

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (only for local DBs during development)

```bash
brew install --cask docker # macOS or Linux (using Homebrew)
winget install -e --id Docker.DockerDesktop # Windows
```

- [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/docs/getting-started) (optional)

```bash
npm install -g turbo # Either install Turbo globally using npm
pnpm install -g turbo # or using pnpm (recommended)
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryanprince/campus-hub.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Create the `.env` file for each app:

```bash
cp apps/student/.env.example apps/student/.env
cp apps/library/.env.example apps/library/.env
cp apps/finance/.env.example apps/finance/.env
```

4. Configure environment variables for each app. Stick to the defaults for the most part.

5. Start the local databases using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

6. Run script to setup the databases with existing migrations and seed data:

```bash
pnpm db:setup
```

7. Start the development server using Turborepo:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

and open [http://localhost:3001 (Student)](http://localhost:3001), [http://localhost:3002 (Library)](http://localhost:3002), and [http://localhost:3003 (Finance)](http://localhost:3003) with your browser üöÄ

8. (Optional) Run the following command to open Drizzle Studio to view the database content from the browser:

```bash
pnpm db:studio
```

and open [https://local.drizzle.studio?port=3011 (Student DB)](https://local.drizzle.studio?port=3011), [https://local.drizzle.studio?port=3012 (Library DB)](https://local.drizzle.studio?port=3012), and [https://local.drizzle.studio?port=3013 (Finance DB)](https://local.drizzle.studio?port=3013) with your browser üóÉÔ∏è

## üìú Scripts

### Database Scripts

Run the following scripts to manage the database schema and data:

```sh
db:studio # Opens Drizzle Studio to view stuff in the database. So cool!
```

```sh
db:push # Pushes database schema directly w/o migrations (prefer db:migrate)
```

```sh
db:migrate:generate # Generates the migration files based on the schema changes
```

```sh
db:migrate:run # Migrates the database using the generated migration files (from db:generate)
```

```sh
db:migrate:push # Generates and runs the migration files in one go (db:generate + db:migrate)
```

```sh
db:seed # Seeds the database with initial data
```

```sh
db:setup # Sets up the database by running db:migrate and db:seed
```

## üìù Note

Developed as part of a university project, Campus Hub highlights my ability to create production-ready applications using the latest technologies and standards. The project is a testament to my skills in software development, showcasing my expertise in building scalable, maintainable, and secure applications. I hope you enjoy exploring Campus Hub and appreciate the effort that went into creating it.
